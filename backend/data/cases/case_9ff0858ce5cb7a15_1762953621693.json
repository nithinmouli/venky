INCIDENT SUMMARY Date of incident: March 14, 2023 Time: Approximately 08:30 AM Location: M.G. Road near Lotus Junction, Bengaluru Weather/Visibility: Clear, dry road surface; good daylight visibility 2. PARTIES INVOLVED Driver A (Vehicle 1 / Private Car): Name: Rajesh Kumar (fictional) Age: 34 Vehicle: Maruti Suzuki Swift (Mock reg. KA-09-AB-4567) Seating: Driver only at time of incident Driver B (Vehicle 2 / Bus): Name: Ramesh Singh (fictional) Employer: City Transport Corporation (CTC) — Mock Division Vehicle: City bus (Mock No. KA-01-F-2234) Seating: Driver and two passengers at time of incident 3. WITNESSES Auto driver: Imran Khan (fictional) — provided written statement. CCTV: Traffic camera #MG-03 captured the event. 4. EVIDENCE COLLECTED - CCTV footage (traffic camera MG-03) — includes approach, overtaking maneuver, and collision frame. - Photos of vehicle damage (both vehicles). - Post-collision vehicle position photos. - Police preliminary accident report (Mock copy). - Medical note for Driver A: sprain and bruising (Mock clinic: City Hospital). - Vehicle repair estimate (Mock workshop: Reliable Autos). 5. FACTUAL CHRONOLOGY 1. At ~08:25–08:29, traffic moving at light-to-moderate flow along M.G. Road. 2. An auto-rickshaw stopped partially in the left lane to pick up a passenger. 3. Bus (Vehicle 2) initiated an overtaking maneuver to pass the stationary auto-rickshaw. 4. During the maneuver, bus moved toward the adjacent lane and contacted the rear-left quarter of the car (Vehicle 1). 5. Vehicle 1 was displaced, struck the central divider and came to rest with frontal and left-side damage. 6. Minor injuries reported by Driver A; bus passengers reported no serious injuries. 6. DAMAGE & INJURY SUMMARY Vehicle 1 (Car): - Front bumper deformation, left front door dented, alignment issues. - Estimated repair cost (mock): n1,75,000 Vehicle 2 (Bus): - Minor scrape to right front panel; no structural damage (mock estimate: n15,000) Injuries: - Driver A: sprained wrist, bruising — medical expenses (mock): n25,000 - Bus occupants: no significant injuries reported 7. ANALYSIS (Independent Observer) - Overtaking clearance: CCTV indicates insufficient lateral clearance during bus overtaking maneuver. - Speed: Both vehicles observed to be within posted speed limits at time of collision (approx. 40–45 km/h). - Contributory factors: Possible sudden deceleration by Vehicle 1 is claimed by Driver B in their statement; however, CCTV does not clearly show abrupt braking by Vehicle 1 prior to contact. Vehicle 1’s partial encroachment into adjacent lane cannot be conclusively determined from a single camera angle. - Primary fault indicator: The overtaking bus failed to maintain safe lateral clearance. Contributory negligence by Vehicle 1 cannot be ruled out without additional evidence (e.g., in-vehicle data or additional camera angles, skid marks). 8. CONCLUSION (Opinion for Testing) - Probable primary cause: Unsafe overtaking maneuver by Bus (Vehicle 2) resulting in contact with Car (Vehicle 1). - Probable contributory factor: Possible lane encroachment or lane-discipline lapse by Car (Vehicle 1) — inconclusive on available evidence. - Recommended outcome for civil testing purposes: Assign primary liability to City Transport Corporation (Bus driver) with 70% responsibility; assign 30% contributory negligence to the driver of the private car. This apportionment is for test scenarios only and is not a legal ruling. 9. RECOMMENDATIONS (Mock) 1. Require driver training refresh for bus operator (simulation-based overtaking safety). 2. Improve signage and physical separation where frequent passenger pick-up occurs. 3. Install additional CCTV coverage (different angles) at the junction for clearer reconstructions. 4. For claims processing in test dataset: approve partial compensation to claimant equal to 70% of assessed losses. SAMPLE — MOCK FIRST INFORMATION REPORT (FIR) (Fictional — FOR TESTING ONLY — NOT A REAL / LEGAL DOCUMENT) FIR No.: MOCK/FIR/2023/0314 Police Station: Central Traffic Police Station, Bengaluru (Mock) Date & Time of Report: March 14, 2023 — 09:05 AM Complainant / Informant: Name: Rajesh Kumar (fictional) Age: 34 Address: 12, Maple Avenue, Koramangala, Bengaluru (Mock) Contact: +91-98XXXXXXX (Mock) Relation to incident: Driver of vehicle reporting collision Details of Incident: On March 14, 2023 at approximately 08:30 AM, the complainant reports that while driving his car (Maruti Suzuki Swift, Reg. KA-09-AB-4567) along M.G. Road, near Lotus Junction, a city bus (Reg. KA-01-F-2234) overtook a stationary auto-rickshaw and collided with the complainant's vehicle, causing damage to the car and minor injuries to the complainant. CCTV footage (traffic camera MG-03) and eyewitness statement from a nearby auto driver (Imran Khan) were recorded. The bus driver, Ramesh Singh, claims the complainant slowed suddenly; however preliminary observations indicate insufficient lateral clearance during overtaking. Sections/Alleged Offences: 1. Endangering life or personal safety by rash or negligent driving (Mock charge). 2. Violation of lane discipline / unsafe overtaking (Mock charge). Evidence Recorded: - CCTV footage (MG-03) captured and attached (Mock). - Eyewitness statement of Imran Khan (Mock). - Photographs of vehicle damage (Mock). - Preliminary medical report of complainant (Mock). Action Taken: 1. Parties advised to file civil claim for damages as applicable (Mock). 2. Preliminary inspection conducted; no arrests made as matter appears to be primarily civil with possible traffic violations pending further enquiry (Mock). 3. FIR registered for record and further investigation (Mock). Signatures / Authentication (Mock) Name & Designation: Inspector S.

    "reasoning": "This case is categorized as an 'intellectual_property' matter. However, both the Plaintiff/Side A and the Defendant/Side B have submitted the exact same document, titled 'mock_accident_report_and_fir_TEST.pdf'. The content of this document is a fictional report detailing a traffic accident, explicitly stating it is 'FOR TESTING ONLY — NOT A REAL / LEGAL DOCUMENT'.\n\nCrucially, neither side has provided any description, argument, or explanation whatsoever to connect this traffic accident report to any intellectual property claim, dispute, or defense. There is no mention of copyright, patent, trademark, design rights, trade secrets, or any other form of intellectual property infringement or ownership in the submissions. The evidence presented is entirely irrelevant to the stated case type.\n\nFor a court to adjudicate an intellectual property case, there must be specific claims regarding intellectual property rights and relevant evidence to support or refute those claims. In the absence of any such claims or relevant evidence, and given that the only submitted document pertains to an unrelated and fictional traffic accident, the Court finds itself with insufficient evidence to make any determination regarding an intellectual property dispute. The submissions fail to establish the very existence or nature of an intellectual property conflict.",
